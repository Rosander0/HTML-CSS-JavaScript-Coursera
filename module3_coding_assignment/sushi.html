        <p>Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, 鮓;) is a traditional Japanese dish made with vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), typically seasoned with sugar and salt, and combined with a variety of ingredients (ねた, neta), such as seafood, vegetables, or meat: raw seafood is the most common, although some may be cooked. While sushi comes in numerous styles and presentation, the current defining component is the vinegared rice, also known as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).</p>
        <p>The modern form of sushi is believed to have been created by Hanaya Yohei, who invented nigiri-zushi, the most commonly recognized type today, in which seafood is placed on hand-pressed vinegared rice. This innovation occurred around 1824 in the Edo period (1603–1867). It was the fast food of the chōnin class in the Edo period.</p>
        <p>Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, although it can also be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is commonly prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Certain types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.</p>
        <p>Narezushi, a dish of fish fermented in rice, is considered an early influence on sushi. Originating in Southeast Asia as a method to preserve freshwater fish, the practice spread to Japan, where fish were fermented with rice vinegar, salt, and rice. The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevented spoilage and provided a vital protein source. The term "sushi" itself means "sour-tasting" and comes from the sour taste of the fermented dish. Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty and was mentioned as a tribute to the Japanese imperial court in the Yōrō Code of 718.</p>
